## Installation
To use Synth ID, simply clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/synth-id.git
```
Then, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd synth-id
```
Ensure you have a PHP environment set up with access to a MySQL database. Import the provided SQL schema file `schema.sql` into your database to set up the necessary tables.
## Usage
Using Synth ID is straightforward. Modify the `generate_id.php` script to specify the desired information for the ID card, such as name, date of birth, and address. Then, run the script to generate the ID card image.
```bash
php generate_id.php
```
The generated ID card image will be saved in the `output` directory.
## Example
Here's a quick example of how to generate an ID card image:
```php
<?php
require_once 'IDCardGenerator.php';
// Initialize ID card generator
$generator = new IDCardGenerator();
// Specify information for the ID card
$info = array(
    "name" => "John Doe",
    "date_of_birth" => "1990-01-01",
    "address" => "123 Main Street, Anytown, USA",
    // Add more information as needed
);
// Generate the ID card image
$generator->generateIDCard($info, "output/id_card.png");
?>
```
